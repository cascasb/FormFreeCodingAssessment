## Assignment 1

This program reads in user input and converts it to doubles 
for the lenght of the triangle sides. If the input can not be
converted into a double, then the user will be prompted to 
enter a valid input. Once a triangle has been identified as 
not a valid triangle, equilateral, isosceles, or scalene the
user has the choice to identify another trinagle. 

## Assignment 2

either contains an int or a string. Several example lists have 
been provided in the Main method. It then traverses it once and 
outputs the list as well as it's fifth element from the end.

## Assignment 3

withinthe project. Several Text files have been provided within the 
project for easier access. If the user replies with 'Y' or 'y'then 
they only need to provide the file name of the text document that is 
located inside the project. If the user replies with 'N' or 'n'then 
they havethe option to input an entire file path. In either case if 
the file cannot be found, then the user is informed that the file 
path is invalid and asked to enter a valid file path. The program then
reads the file and outputs the prime factorizations for the numbers. 
This program only reads text files with one integer per line.
