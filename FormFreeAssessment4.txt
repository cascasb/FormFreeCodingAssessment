## Assessment 4

1. SELECT * FROM Customers
2. SELECT DISTINCT Customers FROM Orders
3. SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE NOT Orders.customer_id = Customers.id
4. I would index both the Customers.id and the Orders.customer_id as 
   they can be used to connect the two tables quickly. I would also index
   Orders.id and Orders.order_address as a quck way to find individual
   orders. Customers.phone_number and Customers.email could also be quick
   ways to find specific customers in the system if their id is unknown
   or unavailable for some reason.
5. SELECT Customers.name, Customers.email, COUNT (Customer.id) AS Orders
   INNER JOIN Customers ON orders.customer_id = Customers.id
6. SELECT COUNT(id)
   FROM Order
   WHERE Orders.customer_id = Customers.id
   BETWEEN 2 AND 5
